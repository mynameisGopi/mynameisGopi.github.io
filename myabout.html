                    <p>Hi there, my name is Gopi. I am originally from Toronto but was brought up in Pickering for much of my life. 
                        My roots traces back to Sri Lanka, a connection I cherish and hope to explore further in the years to come. 
                        Traveling has always been a passion of mine, from the vibrant streets of India to the serene landscapes of Sri Lanka, and I particularly enjoy the freedom of a good road trip.
                        Currently, I'm in my fourth year studying Business Tech Management at Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University), with plans to graduate in April 2025. 
                        Outside of school, you'll often find me watching lots of food vlogs on YouTube, perhaps hinting at a potential culinary calling. Movies are another love of mine; whether it's a Hollywood blockbuster or a hidden gem from Tamil cinema, I'm always up for a good film. 
                        And my curiosity extends beyond the screen to ancient civilizations and mythologies, inspired by the stories my grandmother shared with me during my childhood; let it be the <em>Ramayana</em> or the <em>Mahabharata</em>.
                        <br>
                        Join me as I navigate the intersections of technology, business, and culture with a blend of curiosity and enthusiasm.
                         </br>
